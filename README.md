# GameOfNotesVR

Currently using Unity Version 2020.3.16f1


### There might be this Error:

This error may pop up when opening the project in Unity. Just click ok or ignore or something.

```
An error occurred while resolving packages:
  Project has invalid dependencies:
    com.unity.feature.development: Package [com.unity.feature.development@1.0.1] cannot be found

A re-import of the project may be required to fix the issue or a manual modification of C:/Users/Student/Desktop/Creative-Coding-VR-1819/Offenhäußer-Tim/GameOfNotesVR-VR-version/Packages/manifest.json file.
```

But this error doesn't seem to effect the game, so just ignore it.
