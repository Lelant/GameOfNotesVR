Light and color working now, but why is there no bloom effect anymore? When color is set in script??


There is this Error:
An error occurred while resolving packages:
  Project has invalid dependencies:
    com.unity.feature.development: Package [com.unity.feature.development@1.0.1] cannot be found

A re-import of the project may be required to fix the issue or a manual modification of C:/Users/Student/Desktop/Creative-Coding-VR-1819/Offenhäußer-Tim/GameOfNotesVR-VR-version/Packages/manifest.json file.

What is the function of this package???

Questions/Problems:
- Wie kann ich SteamVR Starten um das HTC Vive Headset + Controller in Unity zu verwenden? Welchen Steam Account brauche ich dazu? Wie lautet der Benutzername und das Passwort?
